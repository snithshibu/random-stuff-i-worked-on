# Description
<b>Coding Language Used:</b> Python<br><br>
<ul>
<li>
  <b>Temperature Convertor:</b> A program that converts temperatures between Celsius, Kelvin and Fahrenheit. 
  This is a beginner-level code. Used functions for conversion, and used conditional statements for showing output.<br><br>
</li>
  <li>
    <b>Random Number Guesser:</b> A program that generates a random number and challenges the user to guess it. 
    The program should prompt the user to input their guess, compare it to the generated number.
    This is a beginner-level code. Didn't use functions, just used iterative loops and conditional staments for aesthetics and continuity. 
    The user get's to decide the difficulty, they keep guessing until they get it right and there are no limit to guesses. 
    Player can keep on playing as long as they want<br><br>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Sudoku Solver</b> A program that solves sudoku puzzles automatically. The Program should take an input grid representing and unsolved Sudoku puzzle and use an algorithm to fill in the missing numbers. 
    There is two ways of doing this, The Naive Approach and The Backtracking Approach.<br>
    <p>The Naive Approach is basically picking an empty square, trying all combinations, finding the right combination, and then moving to the next empty square. 
      Issue with this approach is computation takes a very long time, as there are 81 squares and possible combinations are 9^81, which is a <b>huge</b> number. 
      Another issue is it doesn't always assure an accurate answer.</p> <p>With backtracking, if there is any issue with the numbers we solved, we go back to the previous step and check for other solutions. 
      This is a more recursive step until we get our right answer. Therefore, backtracking is a much better alternative.</p>

    <b>Product Details Web Scarper:</b> A program that extracts product information, such as names, prices, and ratings, 
    from an online e-commerce website and stores the data in a structured format like a CSV file.<br><br>
    <b>Points to Note:</b> 
<ul>
  <li>Not all websites allow webscraping, so don't send multiple requests to the same website as they might block you.</li>
  <li>The code is based on the website I used. Make the necessary changes to the code after inspecting the website HTML.</li>
  <li>The website I used is: http://books.toscrape.com/ - This website is really good to practice webscraping.</li>
</ul>
    <br><br>
    Thats about it, toodles, and don't get scammed!
